Entity System Plan:
==================
Introduce the notion of a system:
- They have implicitly been present all along
- Just a transformation that happens on a group of components periodically
- May depend on several component types
    - i.e. may need to update component A with data from component B, both
      belonging to entity E
- Dependencies between components are entirely defined by systems
    - i.e. System S assumes that every component B has a corresponding
      component A
    - System should fail otherwise
    - Dependency does not exist outside the realm of systems
- Move existing systems into their own files


Todo
=====
- Stabilization controller can be optimized
- Better in-game console (not attached to ship)

Testing
=======
- Multiplayer synchronization?
- Target tracking effectiveness?
- Server clamps client torque?

Known Bugs
==========
- Heap corruption on windows when running client from the Debug directory
